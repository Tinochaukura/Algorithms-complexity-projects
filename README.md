Quicksort Pivot Selection Analysis - Algorithms & Complexity
 
 Task Overview:
This project aims to empirically analyze the execution time of the Quicksort algorithm using different
pivot selection strategies and various types of data inputs. The goal is to compare the performance
of Quicksort based on pivot selection and data order.

Pivot Selection Strategies:
- First element as pivot
- Middle element as pivot
- Random index as pivot
- Median of first, middle, and last element as pivot

Data Types Used:
- Random numbers
- Sorted numbers
- Data sorted in reverse order


Vector Sizes Tested:
10,000 | 20,000 | 30,000 | 40,000 | 50,000


Expected Output:
Tables displaying execution times for each pivot selection strategy and data type combination.
Source Code:


A C++ program to implement Quicksort with the described pivot selection strategies, test it with
different data types, and measure execution time.

Learning Outcome:
Understanding how pivot selection and data order influence Quicksort performance
